# Privacy Policy for ThousandtyOne Clicker

The application is provided free of cost and does not store any of the users data on its server on backend. All data of the user is stored on the users device. The user does have an option to export the data as a JSON file which they are free to upload to any cloud service or any backup storage as they deem fit but the application itself does not store or retrive any of your data without your permission.

## No Sign In

As an app developer myself I take data privacy very seriously and hence the application does not even require the users to sign up or sign in. All functionality of the application is available without providing any data to the application. 

## No Online Calls

The application does not require any internet or connectivity and all functionality is available offline. All data is stored on the users device and never transmitted over any network unless the user themselves choose to export the data. Even in this case the exported data is exported as the file and the user is allowed to use the file as they deem fit. We take no decissions about how the users thoose to use their own data.
